# Rust Reddit API Wrapper (RRAW)

RRAW is a Rust wrapper around the [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api).

## Alternatives

RRAW is early in the development stages with minimal coverage of the Reddit API, and there are alternatives which are significantly more mature. 

If you will need to make HTTP requests to services other than Reddit, then you may prefer working with a higher level HTTP library like the one included in RRAW (reqwest). The alternatives to RRAW use lower level HTTP libraries.
